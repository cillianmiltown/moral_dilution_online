Imagine a friend is telling you about a time they were mugged on holidays and lost their wallet and phone. Fortunately, a by-stander saw the incident and was very helpful to your friend afterwards (providing money and the use of a phone). Their description of the experience includes much detail, including non-relevant information regarding the both the mugger and their helper, e.g., “the mugger was wearing grey shoes”, “they [the helper] lived on the South of the City”. Conventional wisdom suggests that this non-relevant information should not impact your evaluation of either the mugger or the helper, however research suggests this may not be the case.
