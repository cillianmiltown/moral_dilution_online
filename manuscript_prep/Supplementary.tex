\subsection{Pilot: 1: Differences Between Moral Descriptions}\label{pilot-1-differences-between-moral-descriptions}}

We developed a combined moral perception measure by calculating the mean of the combined mean-centered scores for MPS-4 and MM-1, and mean-centering this result. Below we report the analyses for this combined measure.

The standardized means and standard deviations for the combined measure for each scenario are as follows:
\emph{Sam} (diagnostic),
\emph{M} = -0.30, \emph{SD} = 1.16;
\emph{Francis} (diagnostic),
\emph{M} = -0.22, \emph{SD} = 1.06;
\emph{Alex} (diagnostic),
\emph{M} = -0.25, \emph{SD} = 1.10;
\emph{Robin} (diagnostic),
\emph{M} = -0.31, \emph{SD} = 1.19;
\emph{Jackie} (non-diagnostic),
\emph{M} = 0.36, \emph{SD} = 0.55;
\emph{Charlie} (non-diagnostic),
\emph{M} = 0.35, \emph{SD} = 0.55. For the moral descriptions, we observed significant variation depending on the description, \emph{F}(3,602) = 2.67, \emph{p} = .050, partial \(\eta\)\textsuperscript{2} = 0.001. When correcting for multiple comparisons, pairwise comparisons did not reveal significant differences between descriptions. We note that without correction, \emph{Francis} appeared to be rated as more moral than both \emph{Robin} (\emph{p} = .022), and \emph{Sam} (\emph{p} = .021). For the neutral descriptions there was no significant difference in ratings depending on description, \emph{t}(211) = -0.46, \emph{p} = .645, \emph{d} = 0.03.

\hypertarget{pilot-1-testing-moral-vs-neutral}{%
\subsection{Pilot 1: Testing Moral vs Neutral}\label{pilot-1-testing-moral-vs-neutral}}

Overall, the model significantly predicted participants responses, and provided a better fit for the data than the baseline model \(\chi\)\textsuperscript{2}(2) = 1,035.36, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, and condition was a significant predictor in the model \(b\) = -0.31, \emph{t}(210.99) = -8.74, \emph{p} \textless{} .001.

\hypertarget{study-1}{%
\section{Study 1}\label{study-1}}

Again, we created a combined measure of moral perception from both DVs.

The means and standard deviations for the combined measure for each scenario are as follows:
\emph{Sam},
\emph{M} = 0.02, \emph{SD} = 0.89,
\emph{Francis},
\emph{M} = 0.48, \emph{SD} = 1.00,
\emph{Alex},
\emph{M} = -0.21, \emph{SD} = 0.92,
\emph{Robin},
\emph{M} = -0.32, \emph{SD} = 0.94. There was significant variation depending on the description, \emph{F}(3,2255) = 269.01, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, partial \(\eta\)\textsuperscript{2} = 0.10. \emph{Francis} appeared to be rated as the most favorable, followed by \emph{Sam}, then \emph{Alex} and finally \emph{Robin} as the least favorable (all \emph{p}s \textless{} .001).

We conducted a linear-mixed-effects model to test if condition influenced moral perception. Our outcome measure was the combined moral perception measure, our predictor variable was condition; we allowed intercepts and the effect of condition to vary across participants, and scenario was also included in the model.
Overall, the model significantly predicted participants responses, and provided a better fit for the data than the baseline model, \(\chi\)\textsuperscript{2}(8) = 762.31, \emph{p} \textless{} .001. Condition significantly influenced responses to the MPS-4, \emph{F}(1, 799.66) = 57.93, \emph{p} \textless{} .001; and was a significant predictor in the model when controlling for scenario, \(b\) = -0.08, \emph{t}(2,501.32) = -3.42, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, with the non-diagnostic descriptions being rated as more moral than the diagnostic (morally relevant) descriptions of immoral characters Figure~\ref{fig:S1combinedconditionplot}.

For \emph{Francis}, MPS-4 scores were significantly higher for the non-diagnostic condition (\emph{M} = 3.12, \emph{SD} = 0.95), than in the diagnostic condition (\emph{M} = 2.98, \emph{SD} = 0.97), \emph{t}(796.12) = -1.99, \emph{p} = .047, \emph{d} = 0.14; MM-1 ratings were not significantly different in the non-diagnostic condition (\emph{M} = 30.38, \emph{SD} = 17.17), than in the diagnostic condition (\emph{M} = 29.84, \emph{SD} = 18.56), \emph{t}(788.61) = -0.43, \emph{p} = .668, \emph{d} = 0.03.

For \emph{Francis}, MPS-4 scores were not significantly different for the non-diagnostic condition (\emph{M} = 3.84, \emph{SD} = 2.05), than in the diagnostic condition (\emph{M} = 3.60, \emph{SD} = 2.27), \emph{t}(424.52) = -1.17, \emph{p} = .243, \emph{d} = 0.11; MM-1 ratings were not significantly different in the non-diagnostic condition (\emph{M} = 46.97, \emph{SD} = 34.05), than in the diagnostic condition (\emph{M} = 42.03, \emph{SD} = 35.99), \emph{t}(428.22) = -1.47, \emph{p} = .143, \emph{d} = 0.14. For the combined measure ratings were also similar in the non-diagnostic condition (\emph{M} = -0.69, \emph{SD} = 1.08), and in the diagnostic condition (\emph{M} = -0.84, \emph{SD} = 1.18), \emph{t}(425.90) = -1.35, \emph{p} = .179, \emph{d} = 0.13.
